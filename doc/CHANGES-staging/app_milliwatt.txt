Subject: app_milliwatt

The Milliwatt application's existing behavior is
incorrect in that it plays a constant tone, which
is not how digital milliwatt test lines actually
work.

An option is added so that a proper milliwatt test
tone can be provided, including a 1 second silent
interval every 10 seconds. However, for compatability
reasons, the default behavior remains unchanged.
