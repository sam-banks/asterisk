Subject: Handle non-standard Meter metric type safely

A meter_support flag has been introduced that defaults to true to maintain current behaviour.
If disabled, a counter metric type will be used instead wherever a meter metric type was used,
the counter will have a "_meter" suffix appended to the metric name.
