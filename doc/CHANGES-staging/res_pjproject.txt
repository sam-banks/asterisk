Subject: res_pjproject

In pjproject.conf you can now map pjproject log levels
to the Asterisk TRACE log level.  The default mappings
have therefore changed so that only pjproject levels
3 and 4 are mapped to DEBUG and 5 and 6 are now mapped
to TRACE.  Previously 3, 4, 5, and 6 were all mapped to
DEBUG.
