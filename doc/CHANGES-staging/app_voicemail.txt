Subject: app_voicemail

Add a new 'S' option to VoiceMail which prevents the instructions
(vm-intro) from being played if a busy/unavailable/temporary greeting
from the voicemail user is played. This is similar to the existing 's'
option except that instructions will still be played if no user
greeting is available.
