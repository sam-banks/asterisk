Encryption is now supported for RSA authentication.

Currently, these auth configurations will cause a crash:
auth = md5,rsa
auth = plaintext,md5,rsa

With a patched peer, the following will cause a crash:
auth = rsa
auth = md5,rsa
auth = plaintext,md5,rsa

If both the peer and user are patches, no crash occurs.
Existing good configurations should continue to work.
